# Super Mario RL Agent

Train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to play Super Mario Bros using Stable Baselines3 and OpenAI Gym.

## Introduction

This repository contains code to train an RL agent to play the classic video game Super Mario Bros.
The agent learns to navigate through the game environment by maximizing cumulative rewards obtained from the game.

## Features

- Utilizes Stable Baselines3 library for RL algorithm implementation.
- Uses OpenAI Gym for interacting with the Super Mario Bros environment.
- Implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for training the RL agent.
- Provides wrappers for preprocessing game frames (grayscale conversion, frame stacking).
- Supports training and evaluation of the RL agent.
